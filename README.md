Extend the usability of Logitech's® Pro-G Flight Instrument Panels

Logitech's® Pro-G Flight Instrument Panels (FIP) are great for all flight sim enthusiasts.  However, they are limited in scope, having support for only a few flight sims.  The FIP Tool Kit allows developers to create new gauges and other displays.  And it is not limited to just flight simulators.  What is displayed is limited only by your imagination!  I have created a handfull of guages and other displays that are available to all users, not just developers.

  SimConnect Support
  FSUICP© Support
  Assign key presses, SimConnect, or FSUIPC commands to the soft buttons
  Windows® commands support, e.g., launch your default browser, email, or control your PC's volume
  Launch an application
  Perform a single command or a sequence of commands
  Most buttons (with the exception of certain controls, e.g., Spotify) are completely configurable by the user
  MSFS 2020© support with plugin simular to Logitech's.

Note: Developers will need to obtain their own Spotify® API keys.
